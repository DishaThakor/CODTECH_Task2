# Task2 : DEEP LEARNING PROJECT
Company : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS 
Name : Disha Rageshkumar Thakor 
Intern ID : CT08VPQ 
Domain : Data Science 
Duration : 4 weeks

✅ Project Description
This project involves implementing a Deep Learning model for either Image Classification. The model is built using TensorFlow (or PyTorch) and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations of the results (accuracy and loss plots).

✅ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
  TensorFlow / PyTorch — For building and training the deep learning model
  Keras (if using TensorFlow) — For easy model creation
  Matplotlib & Seaborn — For visualization of accuracy, loss, and model performance
  NumPy & Pandas — For data handling and preprocessing
  Jupyter Notebook — For development and results presentation
